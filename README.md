# StatQuest_NeuralNetworks
This is python code to follow along with StatQuest Neural Networks series.

Each episode will contain python code designed to showcase all of the concepts taught in that episode. Mostly this is for my befifit because this is how I learn, but it will be freely available to anyone else who can use it!
